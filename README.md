## Final Update to GitHub Repository

Dear users and contributors,

I want to inform you that I have reached the end of my journey with this specific GitHub repository and will no longer be providing further updates. I have made a last effort to enhance its layout and readability. Additionally, I have ensured the inclusion of the missing reference to the Group-sp_WQM file, which contains the species group information used in the paper.

[Species group](Group-sp_WQM.xlsx) table is based on: 
> Wallace, Carden C., Barbara J. Done, and Paul R. Muir. "Revision and catalogue of worldwide staghorn corals Acropora and Isopora (Scleractinia: Acroporidae) in the Museum of Tropical Queensland." (2012): 1-257.

I would like to extend my sincerest gratitude to all those who have supported and contributed to this project. Your feedback and involvement have been incredibly valuable.

Although I will not actively maintain this repository moving forward, it will remain accessible for reference purposes. Please feel free to explore the codebase and leverage any insights it may offer.

Thank you for being a part of this project.
